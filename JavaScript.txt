1.A :-  The difference is the first one is execute after 2000 miliSeconds,
 which is correct way, and best practice.

1.B :- The second one break the functionality of the waiting time because,
 the function will be called imediately, then returing nothing(Undifined) so there is 
 no item to execute after 2000 miliSeconds.This is not the best practice.

 2,alert(x) : After excuting the function returns 6.
alert(y(2,3)): And Same thing after excuting the function returns 6.

3, Here is the Code:

function booyah1(){
    alert("BOOYAH1");

}  
    function booyah2(){
        
        return (function x(){
            alert("BOOYAH2");
        });
        
    }

4,
Unobtrusive Javascript:
This means it is best practice separating the Javascript from writing inside the html files.
It is also easy to update the code as all the Javascript logic is present in a separate file.
Example: No function call inside button tag, such as onclick.
Main reason is the sepration of concepts:
            - content (html)
            - presentation (css)
            - behavior (js)
